<p>This document is the API specification of the <strong><a href="https://calypsonet.org">Calypso Networks
    Association</a> Terminal Reader API</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Terminal Reader API</strong> should be used by the application layer in charge of setting up the reader
    management:
<ul>
    <li>It defines the interfaces and classes necessary to manage readers, reader events and selection mechanisms.</li>
    <li>It is also used by extension modules to implement functionality related to specific card operations and
        structures.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This API is to be used in conjunction with the <strong>Terminal Card API</strong> also proposed by <strong>Calypso
    Networks Association</strong></p>
